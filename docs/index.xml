      <description>Tokio allows developers to write asynchronous programs in the Rust programming language. Instead of synchronously waiting for long-running operations (like reading a file or waiting for a timer to complete) before moving on to the next thing, Tokio allows developers to write programs where execution continues while the long-running operations are in progress.
More specifically, Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing asynchronous applications with Rust. At a high level, it provides a few major components:</description>

      <title>Hello World!</title>

      <description>为了开始我们的 Tokio 之旅，我们会以惯例“hello world”开始。 这个程序会创建一个 TCP 流并将“hello, world!”写入到流中。 这与未使用 Tokio 写入到 TCP 流的 Rust 程序之间的区别在于，这个程序在创建流或者将“hello, world!”消息写入到流中的时候不会阻塞程序执行。
在开始之前，你应该对 TCP 流的工作原理有最基本的了解。 了解 Rust 的标准库实现也很有帮助。
我们开始吧。
首先，生成一个新的 crate。
$ cargo new hello-world $ cd hello-world  接下来，在 Cargo.toml 中添加必要的依赖项：
[dependencies] tokio = &amp;quot;0.1&amp;quot;  还有 main.rs 中的 crate 与类型：
# #![deny(deprecated)] extern crate tokio; use tokio::io; use tokio::net::TcpStream; use tokio::prelude::*; # fn main() {}  这里我们使用 Tokio 自己的 io 与 net 模块。这俩模块提供与 std 中相应模块几乎相同的网络与 I/O 操作的抽象， 只有很小的差异：所有操作都是异步执行的。</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at futures. Tokio is built on top of the futures crate and uses its runtime model. This allows Tokio to interop with other libraries also using the futures crate.
Note: This runtime model is very different than async libraries found in other languages. While, at a high level, APIs can look similar, the way code gets executed differs.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a closer look at the runtime in the upcoming sections, but a basic understanding of the runtime is necessary to understand futures.</description>

      <description>In the previous section we explored Futures and Streams which allow us to represent a value (in the case of a Future) or a series of values (in the case of Stream) that will be available &amp;ldquo;at some point in the future&amp;rdquo;. We talked about poll on Future and Stream which the runtime will call to figure out if the Future or the Stream are ready to yield a value.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re going to use what has been covered so far to build an echo server. This is a Tokio application that encorporates everything we&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far. The server will simply receive messages from the connected client and send back the same message it received to the client.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be able to test this echo server using the basic Tcp client we created in the hello world section.

      <description>Futures, hinted at earlier in the guide, are the building block used to manage asynchronous logic. They are the underlying asynchronous abstraction used by Tokio.
A future is a value that represents the completion of an asynchronous computation. Usually, the future completes due to an event that happens elsewhere in the system. While we’ve been looking at things from the perspective of basic I/O, you can use a future to represent a wide range of events, e.</description>

      <description>Implementing futures is very common when using Tokio. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a very basic future that performs no asynchronous logic and simply returns a message (the venerable &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo;).
The Future trait. The Future trait is as follows:
trait Future { /// The type of the value returned when the future completes. type Item; /// The type representing errors that occurred while processing the computation. type Error; /// The function that will be repeatedly called to see if the future /// has completed or not.</description>

      <guid>https://tokio-cn.github.io/docs/futures/getting_asynchronous/</guid>
      <description>Futures are all about managing asynchronicity. Implementing a future that completes asynchonously requires correctly handling receiving Async::NotReady from the inner future.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start by implementing a future that establishes a TCP socket with a remote peer and extracts the peer socket address, writing it to STDOUT.
# #![deny(deprecated)] extern crate tokio; #[macro_use] extern crate futures; use tokio::net::{TcpStream, tcp::ConnectFuture}; use futures::{Future, Async, Poll}; struct GetPeerAddr { connect: ConnectFuture, } impl Future for GetPeerAddr { type Item = (); type Error = (); fn poll(&amp;amp;mut self) -&amp;gt; Poll&amp;lt;Self::Item, Self::Error&amp;gt; { match self.</description>

      <guid>https://tokio-cn.github.io/docs/futures/combinators/</guid>
      <description>Often times, Future implementations follow similar patterns. To help reduce boilerplate, the futures crate provides a number of utilities, called &amp;ldquo;combinators&amp;rdquo;, that abstract these patterns. Many of these combinators exist as functions on the Future trait.
Building blocks Let&amp;rsquo;s revisit the future implementations from the previous pages and see how they can be simplified by using combinators.
map The map combinator takes a future and returns a new future that applies a function to the value yielded by the first future.</description>

      <description>Streams are similar to futures, but instead of yielding a single value, they asynchronously yield one or more values. They can be thought of as asynchronous iterators.
Just like futures, streams are able to represent a wide range of things as long as those things produce discrete values at different points sometime in the future. For instance:
 UI Events caused by the user interacting with a GUI in different ways.</description>

      <description>Tokio based applications are organized in terms of Tasks. A task is a small unit of logic that executes independently from other tasks. It is similar to Go&amp;rsquo;s goroutine and Erlang&amp;rsquo;s process, but asynchronous. In other words, tasks are asynchronous green threads. Tasks are spawned for similar reasons that threads are spawned in synchronous code, but spawning a task with Tokio is extremely lightweight.
Previous examples defined a future and passed that future to tokio::run.</description>

      <description>The Rust standard library provides support for networking and I/O, such as TCP connections, UDP sockets, reading from and writing to files, etc. However, those operations are all synchronous, or blocking, meaning that when you call them, the current thread may stop executing and go to sleep until it is unblocked. For example, the read method in std::io::Read will block until there is data to read. In the world of futures, that behavior is unfortunate, since we would like to continue executing other futures we may have while waiting for the I/O to complete.</description>

      <description>Non-blocking I/O In the overview we mentioned briefly that Tokio&amp;rsquo;s I/O types implement non-blocking variants of std::io::Read and std::io::Write called AsyncRead and AsyncWrite. These are an integral part of Tokio&amp;rsquo;s I/O story, and are important to understand when working with I/O code.
 Note: in this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll primarily talk about AsyncRead, but AsyncWrite is pretty much exactly the same, just for writing data to an I/O resource (like a TCP socket) instead of reading from it.</description>

      <description>So far, we have primarily talked about AsyncRead and AsyncWrite in the context of I/O combinators provided by Tokio. While these are often enough, sometimes you need to implement your own combinators that want to perform asynchronous reads and writes directly.
Reading data with AsyncRead The heart of AsyncRead is the poll_read method. It maps the WouldBlock error that indicates that an I/O read operation would have blocked into NotReady, which in turn lets us interoperate with the world of futures.</description>

      <description>Futures, hinted at earlier in the guide, are the building block used to manage asynchronous logic. They are the underlying asynchronous abstraction used by Tokio.
The future implementation is provided by the futures crate. However, for convenience, Tokio re-exports a number of the types.
What Are Futures? A future is a value that represents the completion of an asynchronous computation. Usually, the future completes due to an event that happens elsewhere in the system.</description>

      <guid>https://tokio-cn.github.io/docs/going-deeper/tasks/</guid>
      <description>Tasks are the application&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;unit of logic&amp;rdquo;. They are similar to Go&amp;rsquo;s goroutine and Erlang&amp;rsquo;s process, but asynchronous. In other words, tasks are asynchronous green threads.
Given that a task runs an asynchronous bit of logic, they are represented by the Future trait. The task&amp;rsquo;s future implementation completes with a () value once the task is done processing.
Tasks are passed to executors, which handle scheduling the task. An executor usually is scheduling many tasks across a single or small set of threads.</description>

      <description>现在我们要介绍 Tokio / future 运行时模型。Tokio 建立在 futures crate 之上并使用其运行时模型。这让 Tokio 可以与其他也使用 futures crate 的库进行互操作。
注：这个运行时模型与其他语言中的异步库非常不同。虽然在高级别的 API 上看起来很相似，但是代码执行的方式却并不相同。
同步模型 首先，我们来简要谈谈同步（或阻塞）模型。这是 Rust 标准库使用的模型。
# use std::io::prelude::*; # use std::net::TcpStream; # fn dox(mut socket: TcpStream) { // let socket = ……; let mut buf = [0; 1024]; let n = socket.read(&amp;amp;mut buf).unwrap(); // 使用 &amp;amp;buf[..n]; # } # fn main() {}  当调用 socket.read 时，要么该套接字在其接收缓冲区有待读取的数据， 要么没有。如果有待读取的数据，那么对 read 的调用会立即返回并且以相应数据填充 buf。而如果没有待读取的数据，那么 read 函数会阻塞当前线程直到收到数据。这时，会以这次新接收到的数据填充 buf 并且 read 函数会返回。</description>

      <description>The tokio crate comes with TCP and UDP networking types. Unlike the types in std, Tokio&amp;rsquo;s networking types are based on the poll model and will notify the task executors when their readiness states change (data is received and write buffers are flushed). In the tokio::net module you&amp;rsquo;ll find types like TcpListener, TcpStream, and UdpSocket.
All of these types provide both a future API as well as a poll API.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re going to use what has been covered so far to build a chat server. This is a non-trivial Tokio server application.
The server is going to use a line-based protocol. Lines are terminated by \r\n. This is compatible with telnet, so we will just use telnet for the client. When a client connects, it must identify itself by sending a line containing its &amp;ldquo;nick&amp;rdquo; (i.e., some name used to identify the client amongst its peers).</description>

      <description>When writing a network based application, it is common to need to perform actions based on time.
 Run some code after a set period of time. Cancel a running operation that takes too long. Repeatedly perform an action at an interval.  These use cases are handled by using the various timer APIs that are provided in the timer module.
Running code after a period of time In this case, we want to perform a task after a set period of time.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s also worth spending some time with the trait documentation to familiarize yourself with the full range of combinators available (cheatsheet).
Some concrete futures and streams Any value can be turned into an immediately complete future. There are a few functions in the future module for creating such a future:</description>

      <description>When working with futures, one of the first things you&amp;rsquo;re likely to need to do is to return a Future. As with Iterators, however, doing so can be a little tricky. There are several options, listed from most to least ergonomic:
 Trait objects impl Trait Named types Custom types  Trait objects First, you always have the option of returning a boxed trait object:
# extern crate futures; # use std::io; # use futures::Future; # fn main() {} fn foo() -&amp;gt; Box&amp;lt;Future&amp;lt;Item = u32, Error = io::Error&amp;gt; + Send&amp;gt; { // .</description>

      <description>Tokio has helpers to transform a stream of bytes into a stream of frames. Examples of byte streams include TCP connections, pipes, file objects and the standard input and output file descriptors. In Rust, streams are easily identified because they implement the Read and Write traits.
One of the simplest forms of framed message is the line delimited message. Each message ends with a \n character. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how one would implement a stream of line delimited messages with tokio.</description>

      <description>The runtime ‒ all the pieces needed to run an event driven application ‒ is already available. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to know this if you want to just use tokio. However, it may be useful to know what happens under the hood, both to gain some more understanding of the details in case something goes wrong, and to be able to customize it beyond what the runtime Builder supports.</description>

      <description>Applications written using Tokio are organized across a large number of small, non-blocking tasks. A Tokio task is similar to a goroutine or an Erlang process, but is non-blocking. They are designed to be lightweight, can be spawned fast, and maintain low scheduling overhead. They are also non-blocking, as such operations that are not able to finish immediately must still return immediately. Instead of returning the result of the operation, they return a value indicating that the operation is in progress.</description>

      <description>This section describes the network resources and drivers provided by Tokio. This component provides one of Tokio&amp;rsquo;s primary functions: non-blocking, event-driven, networking provided by the appropriate operating system primitives (epoll, kqueue, IOCP, &amp;hellip;). It is modeled after the resource and driver pattern described in the previous section.
The network driver is built using mio and network resources are backed by types that implement Evented.
This guide will be focused on TCP types.</description>
