      <description>Tokio allows developers to write asynchronous programs in the Rust programming language. Instead of synchronously waiting for long-running operations (like reading a file or waiting for a timer to complete) before moving on to the next thing, Tokio allows developers to write programs where execution continues while the long-running operations are in progress.
More specifically, Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing asynchronous applications with Rust. At a high level, it provides a few major components:</description>

      <description>The release of Tokio 0.2 was the culmination of a great deal of hard work from numerous contributors, and has brought several significant improvements to Tokio. Using std::future and async/await makes writing async code using Tokio much more ergonomic, and a new scheduler implementation makes Tokio 0.2&amp;rsquo;s thread pool as much as 10x faster. However, updating existing Tokio 0.1 projects to use 0.2 and std::future poses some new challenges. Therefore, we&amp;rsquo;re very excited to announce the release of the tokio-compat crate to help ease this transition, by providing a runtime compatible with both Tokio 0.</description>

      <description>We are excited to announce Thomas de Zeeuw as the new lead of Mio. Mio is the low level I/O portability abstraction that backs Tokio and other Rust projects. Thomas has been behind most of the Mio 0.7 effort and will be continuing to lead the crate to 1.0. He has written the rest of the announcement.
Mio 0.7 is the work of various contributors over the course of roughly half a year.</description>

      <description>We are very excited to announce Tokio 0.2. This is a ground up rework of Tokio based on async / await and experience gained over the past three years.
Add the following to Cargo.toml:
tokio = { version = &amp;quot;0.2&amp;quot;, features = [&amp;quot;full&amp;quot;] }  This is a major update, and as such there are changes to almost all parts of the library. To highlight a few:
 Based on async / await for superior ergonomics.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work on the next major revision of Tokio, Rust&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous runtime. Today, a complete rewrite of the scheduler has been submitted as a pull request. The result is huge performance and latency improvements. Some benchmarks saw a 10x speed up! It is always unclear how much these kinds of improvements impact &amp;ldquo;full stack&amp;rdquo; use cases, so we&amp;rsquo;ve also tested how these scheduler improvements impacted use cases like Hyper and Tonic (spoiler: it&amp;rsquo;s really good).</description>

      <description>Effectively developing systems and operating them in production requires visibility into their behavior at runtime. While conventional logging can provide some of this visibility, asynchronous software &amp;mdash; like applications using the Tokio runtime &amp;mdash; introduces new challenges.
tracing is a collection of libraries that provide a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect structured, context-aware, event driven diagnostics. Note that tracing was originally released under the name tokio-trace; the name was changed to reflect that, although it is part of the Tokio project, the tokio runtime is not required to use tracing.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re pleased to announce the release of the first Tokio alpha with async &amp;amp; await support. This includes updating all of the Tokio crates to use std::future instead of futures 0.1. It also includes adding async fn versions of the APIs.
Get it by adding:
tokio = &amp;quot;=0.2.0-alpha.1&amp;quot;  to your Cargo.toml file. This is how an echo server is now written:
#![feature(async_await)] use tokio::net::TcpListener; use tokio::prelude::*; #[tokio::main] async fn main() -&amp;gt; Result&amp;lt;(), Box&amp;lt;dyn std::error::Error&amp;gt;&amp;gt; { let addr = &amp;quot;127.</description>

      <description>A year ago, Tokio was a very different library. It includes the (now deprecated) tokio-core which provided a future executor, I/O selector, and basic TCP/UDP types in a single library. It also included tokio-proto, but we won&amp;rsquo;t talk about that. Over the past year, Tokio has grown to become Rust&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous I/O platform. It has been adopted by a number of large companies to build apps.
A lot was achieved in 2018.</description>

      <description>In the past, there has been reoccurring feedback that Tokio is hard to understand. I believe a lack of good documentation plays a significant part. It&amp;rsquo;s time to fix this problem.
And because Tokio is open source, it is on us (the community) to make this happen! 👏
But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, this isn&amp;rsquo;t an aimless request to contribute documentation. It does, however, require participation. There are ways to get involved at any level of prior Tokio experience.</description>

      <description>Happy Monday!
In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, async / await is a big new feature that is being worked on for Rust. It aims to make asynchronous programming easy (well, at least a little bit easier than it is today). The work has been on going for a while and is already usable today on the Rust nightly channel.
I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that Tokio now has experimental async / await support!</description>

      <description>It took a bit longer than I had initially hoped (as it always does), but a new Tokio version has been released. This release includes, among other features, a new set of APIs that allow performing filesystem operations from an asynchronous context, concurrency improvements, timer improvements, and more (including bug fixes, so be sure to update!).
It has been a little bit since the last post. There haven&amp;rsquo;t been any big feature releases, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we have been idle.</description>

Filesystem APIs Interacting with files (and other filesystem types) requires* blocking system calls and we all know that blocking and asynchronous do not mix. So, historically, when people ask &amp;ldquo;how do I read from and write to files?</description>

      <description>Happy Friday all!
To close out a great week, there is a new release of Tokio. This release includes a brand new timer implementation.
Timers Sometimes (often), one wants to execute code in relation to time. Maybe a function needs to run at a specific instant. Maybe a read needs to be limited to a fixed duration. For working with time, one needs access to a timer!
Some history The tokio-timer crate has been around for a while.</description>

      <description>Hi all!
I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that today, the changes proposed in the reform RFC have been released to crates.io as tokio 0.1.
The primary changes are:
 Add a default global event loop, eliminating the need for setting up and managing your own event loop in the vast majority of cases.
 Decouple all task execution functionality from Tokio.
  The new global event loop Up until today, creating an event loop was a manual process.</description>

      <description>Hi there, Tokio community!
Carl, Alex, and myself have been hard at work developing ways to simplify, streamline, and focus the Tokio project. As part of this effort, we have written the first-ever Tokio RFC!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick run-down of what&amp;rsquo;s being proposed.
 Add a global event loop in tokio-core that is managed automatically by default. This change eliminates the need for setting up and managing your own event loop in the vast majority of cases.</description>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce a new crate and several new tools to work with in the Tokio stack. This represents the culmination of a number of parallel updates to various bits and pieces, they just happened to conveniently land all around the same time! In a nutshell the improvements are:
 A new tokio-io crate extracted from tokio-core, deprecating the tokio_core::io module. Introduction of the bytes crate to tokio-io allowing abstraction over buffering and leveraging underlying functionality like vectored I/O.</description>

      <description>Today we are publishing the preliminary version of the Tokio stack, 0.1!
Tokio is a platform for writing fast networking code in Rust. It&amp;rsquo;s built on futures, a zero-cost abstraction for asynchronous programming in Rust. It provides a suite of basic tools, tokio-core, for asynchronous I/O with futures. It also provides a higher-level layer, tokio-proto, for easily building sophisticated servers and clients; all you have to do is handle message serialization.</description>

To check version of Rust on the command line:
rustc --version rustc 1.39.0 (4560ea788 2019-11-04)  In version 1.39.0, Rust introduced async-await, see the Async Book for in-depth documentation of these new Rust language features. This guide also seeks to provide a practical, hands-on introduction for all of the Rust language features that are needed for programming with Tokio.</description>

      <description>Feel free to skip this section, and just use features = [&amp;quot;full&amp;quot;] while learning. This section provides some examples of how and when to choose specific feature groups in Cargo.toml.
Often using all features is fine When writing an app, we&amp;rsquo;ll often use all of Tokio&amp;rsquo;s features to accelerate our development time.
Cargo.toml:
[dependencies] tokio = { version = &amp;quot;0.2&amp;quot;, features = [&amp;quot;full&amp;quot;] }  For most apps, the additional compile time is hardly noticeable relative to the cognitive overhead of thinking about which features are needed.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at Rust&amp;rsquo;s async fn feature. Tokio is built on top of Rust&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous model. This allows Tokio to interop with other libraries also using the futures crate.
Note: This runtime model is very different than async libraries found in other languages. While, at a high level, APIs can look similar, the way code gets executed differs.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a closer look at the runtime in the upcoming sections, but a basic understanding of the runtime is necessary to understand futures.</description>

      <description>In the previous section we explored async fn Futures which allow us to represent a value that will be available &amp;ldquo;at some point in the future&amp;rdquo;. We mentioned that a Rust Future requires something to poll it for completion and said that the something is the Tokio runtime.
Tokio runtime The Runtime is responsible for repeatedly calling poll on a Future until its value is returned. There are a few different ways this can happen in practice.</description>

The server will simply receive messages from the connected client and send back the same message it received to the client.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be able to test this echo server using the basic Tcp client we created in the hello world section.

      <description>Futures, hinted at earlier in the guide, are the building block used to manage asynchronous logic. They are the underlying asynchronous abstraction used by Tokio.
A future is a value that represents the completion of an asynchronous computation. Usually, the future completes due to an event that happens elsewhere in the system. While we’ve been looking at things from the perspective of basic I/O, you can use a future to represent a wide range of events, e.</description>

      <description>Implementing futures is very common when using Tokio. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a very basic future that performs no asynchronous logic and simply returns a message (the venerable &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo;).
The Future trait. The Future trait is as follows:
trait Future { /// The type of the value returned when the future completes. type Item; /// The type representing errors that occurred while processing the computation. type Error; /// The function that will be repeatedly called to see if the future /// has completed or not.</description>

      <description>Futures are all about managing asynchronicity. Implementing a future that completes asynchronously requires correctly handling receiving Async::NotReady from the inner future.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start by implementing a future that establishes a TCP socket with a remote peer and extracts the peer socket address, writing it to STDOUT.
# #![deny(deprecated)] extern crate tokio; #[macro_use] extern crate futures; use tokio::net::{TcpStream, tcp::ConnectFuture}; use futures::{Future, Async, Poll}; struct GetPeerAddr { connect: ConnectFuture, } impl Future for GetPeerAddr { type Item = (); type Error = (); fn poll(&amp;amp;mut self) -&amp;gt; Poll&amp;lt;Self::Item, Self::Error&amp;gt; { match self.</description>

      <description>Often times, Future implementations follow similar patterns. To help reduce boilerplate, the futures crate provides a number of utilities, called &amp;ldquo;combinators&amp;rdquo;, that abstract these patterns. Many of these combinators exist as functions on the Future trait.
Building blocks Let&amp;rsquo;s revisit the future implementations from the previous pages and see how they can be simplified by using combinators.
map The map combinator takes a future and returns a new future that applies a function to the value yielded by the first future.</description>

      <description>Streams are similar to futures, but instead of yielding a single value, they asynchronously yield one or more values. They can be thought of as asynchronous iterators.
Just like futures, streams are able to represent a wide range of things as long as those things produce discrete values at different points sometime in the future. For instance:
 UI Events caused by the user interacting with a GUI in different ways.</description>

      <description>Tokio based applications are organized in terms of Tasks. A task is a small unit of logic that executes independently from other tasks. It is similar to Go&amp;rsquo;s goroutine and Erlang&amp;rsquo;s process, but asynchronous. In other words, tasks are asynchronous green threads. Tasks are spawned for similar reasons that threads are spawned in synchronous code, but spawning a task with Tokio is extremely lightweight.
Previous examples defined a future and passed that future to tokio::run.</description>

      <description>The Rust standard library provides support for networking and I/O, such as TCP connections, UDP sockets, reading from and writing to files, etc. However, those operations are all synchronous, or blocking, meaning that when you call them, the current thread may stop executing and go to sleep until it is unblocked. For example, the read method in std::io::Read will block until there is data to read. In the world of futures, that behavior is unfortunate, since we would like to continue executing other futures we may have while waiting for the I/O to complete.</description>

      <description>Non-blocking I/O In the overview we mentioned briefly that Tokio&amp;rsquo;s I/O types implement non-blocking variants of std::io::Read and std::io::Write called AsyncRead and AsyncWrite. These are an integral part of Tokio&amp;rsquo;s I/O story, and are important to understand when working with I/O code.
 Note: in this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll primarily talk about AsyncRead, but AsyncWrite is pretty much exactly the same, just for writing data to an I/O resource (like a TCP socket) instead of reading from it.</description>

      <description>So far, we have primarily talked about AsyncRead and AsyncWrite in the context of I/O combinators provided by Tokio. While these are often enough, sometimes you need to implement your own combinators that want to perform asynchronous reads and writes directly.
Reading data with AsyncRead The heart of AsyncRead is the poll_read method. It maps the WouldBlock error that indicates that an I/O read operation would have blocked into NotReady, which in turn lets us interoperate with the world of futures.</description>

      <description>Futures, hinted at earlier in the guide, are the building block used to manage asynchronous logic. They are the underlying asynchronous abstraction used by Tokio.
The future implementation is provided by the futures crate. However, for convenience, Tokio re-exports a number of the types.
What Are Futures? A future is a value that represents the completion of an asynchronous computation. Usually, the future completes due to an event that happens elsewhere in the system.</description>

      <description>Tasks are the application&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;unit of logic&amp;rdquo;. They are similar to Go&amp;rsquo;s goroutine and Erlang&amp;rsquo;s process, but asynchronous. In other words, tasks are asynchronous green threads.
Given that a task runs an asynchronous bit of logic, they are represented by the Future trait. The task&amp;rsquo;s future implementation completes with a () value once the task is done processing.
Tasks are passed to executors, which handle scheduling the task. An executor usually is scheduling many tasks across a single or small set of threads.</description>

      <description>现在我们要介绍 Tokio / future 运行时模型。Tokio 建立在 futures crate 之上并使用其运行时模型。这让 Tokio 可以与其他也使用 futures crate 的库进行互操作。
注：这个运行时模型与其他语言中的异步库非常不同。虽然在高级别的 API 上看起来很相似，但是代码执行的方式却并不相同。
同步模型 首先，我们来简要谈谈同步（或阻塞）模型。这是 Rust 标准库使用的模型。
# use std::io::prelude::*; # use std::net::TcpStream; # fn dox(mut socket: TcpStream) { // let socket = ……; let mut buf = [0; 1024]; let n = socket.read(&amp;amp;mut buf).unwrap(); // 使用 &amp;amp;buf[..n]; # } # fn main() {}  当调用 socket.read 时，要么该套接字在其接收缓冲区有待读取的数据， 要么没有。如果有待读取的数据，那么对 read 的调用会立即返回并且以相应数据填充 buf。而如果没有待读取的数据，那么 read 函数会阻塞当前线程直到收到数据。这时，会以这次新接收到的数据填充 buf 并且 read 函数会返回。</description>

      <description>The tokio crate comes with TCP and UDP networking types. Unlike the types in std, Tokio&amp;rsquo;s networking types are based on the poll model and will notify the task executors when their readiness states change (data is received and write buffers are flushed). In the tokio::net module you&amp;rsquo;ll find types like TcpListener, TcpStream, and UdpSocket.
All of these types provide both a future API as well as a poll API.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re going to use what has been covered so far to build a chat server. This is a non-trivial Tokio server application.
The server is going to use a line-based protocol. Lines are terminated by \r\n. This is compatible with telnet, so we will just use telnet for the client. When a client connects, it must identify itself by sending a line containing its &amp;ldquo;nick&amp;rdquo; (i.e., some name used to identify the client amongst its peers).</description>

      <description>When writing a network based application, it is common to need to perform actions based on time.
 Run some code after a set period of time. Cancel a running operation that takes too long. Repeatedly perform an action at an interval.  These use cases are handled by using the various timer APIs that are provided in the timer module.
Running code after a period of time In this case, we want to perform a task after a set period of time.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s also worth spending some time with the trait documentation to familiarize yourself with the full range of combinators available (cheatsheet).
Some concrete futures and streams Any value can be turned into an immediately complete future. There are a few functions in the future module for creating such a future:</description>

      <description>When working with futures, one of the first things you&amp;rsquo;re likely to need to do is to return a Future. As with Iterators, however, doing so can be a little tricky. There are several options, listed from most to least ergonomic:
 Trait objects impl Trait Named types Custom types  Trait objects First, you always have the option of returning a boxed trait object:
# extern crate futures; # use std::io; # use futures::Future; # fn main() {} fn foo() -&amp;gt; Box&amp;lt;Future&amp;lt;Item = u32, Error = io::Error&amp;gt; + Send&amp;gt; { // .</description>

      <description>Tokio has helpers to transform a stream of bytes into a stream of frames. Examples of byte streams include TCP connections, pipes, file objects and the standard input and output file descriptors. In Rust, streams are easily identified because they implement the Read and Write traits.
One of the simplest forms of framed message is the line delimited message. Each message ends with a \n character. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how one would implement a stream of line delimited messages with tokio.</description>

      <description>The runtime ‒ all the pieces needed to run an event driven application ‒ is already available. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to know this if you want to just use tokio. However, it may be useful to know what happens under the hood, both to gain some more understanding of the details in case something goes wrong, and to be able to customize it beyond what the runtime Builder supports.</description>

      <description>Applications written using Tokio are organized across a large number of small, non-blocking tasks. A Tokio task is similar to a goroutine or an Erlang process, but is non-blocking. They are designed to be lightweight, can be spawned fast, and maintain low scheduling overhead. They are also non-blocking, as such operations that are not able to finish immediately must still return immediately. Instead of returning the result of the operation, they return a value indicating that the operation is in progress.</description>

      <description>This section describes the network resources and drivers provided by Tokio. This component provides one of Tokio&amp;rsquo;s primary functions: non-blocking, event-driven, networking provided by the appropriate operating system primitives (epoll, kqueue, IOCP, &amp;hellip;). It is modeled after the resource and driver pattern described in the previous section.
The network driver is built using mio and network resources are backed by types that implement Evented.
This guide will be focused on TCP types.</description>

      <description>The word &amp;ldquo;telnet&amp;rdquo; often refers to the Telnet client, since the command to run the client has the same name as the protocol. This page is about the telnet client which we use in this guide to test and debug servers.
Telnet is a computer protocol that was built for interacting with remote computers ([IETF RFC-854]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc854).
Telnet utility allows users to test connectivity to remote machines and issue commands through the use of a keyboard, and one of the simplest ways to check if a port is open and listening on a network.</description>
